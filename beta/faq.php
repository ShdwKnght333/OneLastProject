				<div class="cd-faq-content">
					<p>Foodzoned is an online food ordering portal which consists of the varied menus of all the food joints enlisted on it. The website acts as a one-step go platform for the users who wish to order food online. The website releases the users from the humdrum of carrying printed menu cards and searching for restaurant phone numbers.<br/><br/>
                    The easy and appealing UI of the website allows the users to order the food of their choice with a few clicks. The users can experiment with different cuisines available with the restaurant even when ordering from home and thus they can bring in the fine dining experience.<br/><br/>
                    Foodzoned aims at bridging the gap that exists between the user and the restaurant and thus providing the ultimate food experience to the masses.</p>

                        Foodzoned Guarantee won't be applicable on days when any procession/rally/march/road construction etc is taking place which affects the normal process of delivery.<br/><br/>
                        FZ Management reserves the right to revoke all types of guarantees at any point in time without prior intimation. Final decision on the same rests with the management which is non-contestable and fully binding.<br/><br/>
